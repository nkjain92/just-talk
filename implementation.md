# Just-Talk Implementation Progress

## Project Setup (Completed)

- Created the basic project structure with core modules:
  - `core/` - Core functionality (audio, transcription, text processing)
  - `data/` - Data management (database, history, statistics)
  - `platforms/` - Platform-specific code (macOS text insertion)
  - `ui/` - User interface components
  - `services/` - Additional services (updater, analytics)
- Added all necessary Python files with empty implementations
- Created requirements.txt with required dependencies:
  - PyQt6 - UI framework
  - sounddevice - Audio recording
  - requests - API communication
  - PyObjC - macOS native functionality
  - pynput - Global hotkey registration
  - pyinstaller - Application packaging
- Successfully installed all dependencies
- Tested basic PyQt6.QtWidgets functionality to ensure proper setup

## Audio Recording (Completed)

- Implemented AudioManager class in core/audio_manager.py
- Features:
  - On-demand audio recording triggered by Option/Alt key press
  - Release key to stop recording
  - 30-second automatic timeout
  - Continuous streaming audio capture using sounddevice
  - Efficient audio capture in small chunks (100ms) for uninterrupted recording
  - Saving audio to temp_audio.wav in WAV format
  - Error handling for empty recordings and exceptions
  - Status feedback via console messages
- Optimized recording to prevent audio gaps and interruptions:
  - Using sd.InputStream for continuous streaming
  - Proper stream management (creation/closing)
  - Multi-threaded approach to keep UI responsive
  - Small chunk size for smoother recording
- Successfully tested recording functionality and verified audio quality
