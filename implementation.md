# Just-Talk Implementation Progress

## Project Setup (Completed)

- Created the basic project structure with core modules:
  - `core/` - Core functionality (audio, transcription, text processing)
  - `data/` - Data management (database, history, statistics)
  - `platforms/` - Platform-specific code (macOS text insertion)
  - `ui/` - User interface components
  - `services/` - Additional services (updater, analytics)
- Added all necessary Python files with empty implementations
- Created requirements.txt with required dependencies:
  - PyQt6 - UI framework
  - sounddevice - Audio recording
  - requests - API communication
  - PyObjC - macOS native functionality
  - pynput - Global hotkey registration
  - pyinstaller - Application packaging
- Successfully installed all dependencies
- Tested basic PyQt6.QtWidgets functionality to ensure proper setup

## Audio Recording (Completed)

- Implemented AudioManager class in core/audio_manager.py
- Features:
  - On-demand audio recording triggered by Option/Alt key press
  - Release key to stop recording
  - 30-second automatic timeout
  - Continuous streaming audio capture using sounddevice
  - Efficient audio capture in small chunks (100ms) for uninterrupted recording
  - Saving audio to temp_audio.wav in WAV format
  - Error handling for empty recordings and exceptions
  - Status feedback via console messages
- Optimized recording to prevent audio gaps and interruptions:
  - Using sd.InputStream for continuous streaming
  - Proper stream management (creation/closing)
  - Multi-threaded approach to keep UI responsive
  - Small chunk size for smoother recording
- Successfully tested recording functionality and verified audio quality

## Transcription (Completed)

- Implemented basic transcription functionality in core/transcription.py
- Features:
  - Integration with DeepGram API for speech-to-text conversion
  - Simple API key management using .env file
  - Error handling for API failures
  - Successfully tested with temp_audio.wav files from AudioManager
- Created a thread-safe UI update mechanism in main.py
  - Signal/slot pattern for safe UI updates from worker threads
  - Separate worker thread for transcription to keep UI responsive
  - Status updates during transcription process

## Learnings

### Audio Recording

- Use `Option/Alt` key (keyboard.Key.alt) for recording trigger, NOT Function key
- Handle audio stream properly (create before recording, close after)
- Always use a separate thread for audio recording to prevent UI freezing
- Sample rate of 44100Hz and 16-bit mono produces good quality recordings
- Wait for recording thread to complete before saving audio with thread.join()

### Transcription API

- DeepGram SDK has different versions with different APIs:
  - Version 2.x uses `Deepgram` class and `sync_prerecorded` method
  - Version 3.x uses `DeepgramClient` class and different method structure
- For version 2.x (current implementation):
  - Must pass `mimetype` parameter when using buffer data
  - Correct source format: `{'buffer': file_object, 'mimetype': 'audio/wav'}`
  - Basic options: `{'punctuate': True, 'smart_format': True}`
- Always check API documentation for version-specific implementation details
- For model selection, simpler is often better for initial implementation

### Thread Safety in Qt

- Never update UI directly from worker threads
- Use Signal/Slot pattern for thread-safe UI updates:
  - Define signals in a class that inherits from QObject
  - Connect signals to slots in the main thread
  - Emit signals from worker threads to trigger UI updates safely
- Common mistake: Trying to update UI elements directly from audio callback thread
- Always inherit from QObject when using signals/slots

### Minimizing Features for Testing

- KISS principle: Keep It Simple for Setup/Testing
- Focus on core functionality first:
  1. Basic UI window setup
  2. Audio recording with keyboard trigger
  3. Basic transcription and result display
- Avoid adding extra features like:
  - Model selection dropdowns
  - Multiple recording methods
  - Direct API testing with curl
  - Complex UI layouts
- Only add complexity when core functionality is verified and working

### File Management

- Keep file access code in try/except blocks to handle permissions issues
- Check for file existence before attempting to use it
- Use standardized paths for temporary files
- Log file operations for debugging purposes
